# EASI Notebooks <img align="right" src="../resources/csiro_easi_logo.png">

Jupyter notebooks for learning and advancing your use of EASI, https://research.csiro.au/cceo/underpinning-technologies/earth-analytics/.

- Use the examples in these notebooks to build your own data analysis and applications.
- These notebooks have been adapted and written for CSIRO's EASI deployments.

These notebooks build on and contribute to the [Open Data Cube](https://github.com/opendatacube), [CEOS](https://ceos.org) and cloud-based EO analytics communities ([Acknowledgment and Credit](../README.md#Acknowledgment-and-Credit)).

## HTML notebooks

Github will render a notebook in the browser but its expensive to save cell outputs in notebooks, particularly if they contain javascript visualisations.
So we create HTML-rendered versions of the notebooks with their outputs, prior to stripping away the outputs.
However, HTML files are not directly rendered in github but can be rendered by [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com).

Here are the githack links to each of the HTML rendered notebooks.

> `main` branch by default. Edit a URL for a specific branch, or go to https://raw.githack.com/.
